Description: Decompose given hierarchical clustering tree into
        non-overlapping clusters in a semi-supervised way by using
        available patients follow-up information as guidance. Contains
        functions for snipping HC tree, various cluster quality
        evaluation criteria, assigning new patients to one of the two
        given HC trees, testing the significance of clusters with
        permutation argument and clusters visualization using sample's
        molecular entropy.
